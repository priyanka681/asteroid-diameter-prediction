This repository focuses on predicting the diameter of asteroids using publicly available datasets and machine learning techniques. Accurate estimation of asteroid diameters is essential for assessing potential threats and planning mitigation strategies, such as deflection or destruction of hazardous asteroids.

**Problem Statement**

Asteroids, minor planets of the inner Solar System, vary significantly in size and shape. Predicting their diameters is a challenging regression problem, crucial for understanding their potential impact and designing proactive defense measures. Key considerations include:

**Significance of Diameter:**

Asteroids larger than 1–2 km in diameter can cause global effects in case of a collision.
Smaller asteroids (25m–1 km) can cause localized damage.

Objective: Maximize the R² score or minimize the mean squared error (MSE) for diameter predictions.
Dataset
The dataset used is publicly available on Kaggle: Asteroid Diameter Prediction Dataset. The data was originally obtained from NASA's Small-Body Database Query by Victor Basu.

**Key Libraries**

pandas - For data manipulation
numpy - For numerical computations
matplotlib & seaborn - For data visualization
scikit-learn - For machine learning models
statsmodels - For statistical modeling
